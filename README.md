# task-tracker

Task Tracker test application. Built using requirejs and Ractive for templating and dom manipulation. I've included the standalone version of Jasmine in order to run the unit tests I wrote for the TaskManger class. You'll have to navigate in to the jasmine folder and run SpecRunner.html. If I had a bit more time, I would have added form validation. Don't forget to run "bower install" to download the dependencies needed to run the app!
